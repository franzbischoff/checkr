\title{Apply passif/failif/okif tests to an identified code object}
\usage{
check(ex, ..., message = "Sorry!")
}
\arguments{
\item{ex}{the examiner_result object with a single line of code}

\item{...}{passif/failif tests to be applied}

\item{message}{a character string to be used as the message for a failed result}
}
\value{
a examiner_result object reflecting the outcome of the tests
}
\description{
A generic testing function for applying passif/failif tests with V and EX bindings
to a examiner_result object. Unlike \code{line_where()}, other line functions, no patterns
need to be provided. Just the passif/failif tests.
}
\examples{
code <- for_examiner(quote({x <- 3; y <- x^2 + 2}))
line2 <- line_where(code, insist(Z == "y"))
check(line2, passif(V == 11, "Right, eleven!"),
      message = "Sorry. The result should be 11.")
}
